### Instructions for the installers and notes.

All the default values for the installers are fine. Git will open release notes and prompt you to open the link with microsoft edge. go ahead and chose "use once" and open and close that page.
**DO NOT OPEN VISUAL STUDIO CODE WITHOUT INSTALLING Git and Node first. Otherwise you'll have to close and reopen visual studio code**
